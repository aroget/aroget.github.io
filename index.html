      <p>Hola, my name is Andres and I like everything web, I currently spend most of my time working as full time front end developer in Montreal, Canada, though I am always looking for freelance gigs and volunteering work.</p>
      <p>When I am not coding I enjoy reading about new front end techniques and work flows, my favorite languages are JS, PHP and CSS.</p>

    <h3>Angular Contacts (In Progress)<span class="small">(MEAN Stack Development)</span></h3>
    <p>Quick contact list web app, using MongoDB, express, angular and the Twilio API, the app allows you to save/edit/delete contacts, upload a profile image and from the app, send them an SMS or Call, I'm using a free trial for Twilio so unfortunately the SMS option only works when sending messages to my phone so far, I may check out the pro version and add this ability as well, this app is a work in progress and further enhancements are expected.</p>

    <h3>Angular Countries<span class="small">(Angular.JS, Development)</span></h3>
    <p>I love traveling and discover new countries and cultures yet I find it extremely hard to find all the information I need about a place without having to visit at least another three sites, this why I started this project, right now it only connects to two APIs returning all the countries and capitals in the world and populating it with some images using the 500px API, once in a city or country it gives you a bit more information about it. I am still having a hard time getting more information about these places, as there does not seem to be an open source library with this information.</p>

    <h3>Ember Events (Work In Progress)<span class="small">(MEEN Stack Development)</span></h3>
    <p>The idea behind the project came while looking for new hackathons in Montreal and not finding a single source to list them all, in order to find out what's going on in the city you would need to follow tons of people on social media in order to get the updates, so I decided to build a small app that allows people to list upcoming events in the city. This is still a work in progress!</p>

    <h3>Angular Reddit<span class="small">(MEAN Stack Development)</span></h3>
    <p>After several months of Ember development I decided to give Angular a try, despite knowing v2.0 might be a completely different code, I still see several apps built on Angular as well as job posts looking for Angular developers more often than Ember, so I decided to give it a try and here is my first app. Using yeoman / angular, reddit to pull some data and heroku to deploy my app, this little app allows you to read latest reddits on a much nicer user interface.</p>

    <h3>News App<span class="small">(Ember & Node & MongoDB & API Development)</span></h3>
    <p>Playing around with MongoDB, I came up with this quick Web App, that pulls data from 3 news APIs (The New York Times, NPR and The Guardian), it also allows you to select your topic and view a list of Favorites. The App uses Ember CLI for the fronted with a node back end connected to a MongoDB database via an API.</p>

    <h3>Express Music<span class="small">(Node.js, Express.js, API, & Full Stack Development)</span></h3>
    <p>While playing around with Express, I built a similar app than last time, but this time I am requesting data from two APIs and rendering it to the user on page load, feel free to reload your results page or share it with a friend as it will execute the GET request and render the same results. In the near future I will update it to include a voting system, plus additional routes like by Genre and single record view. Just like the previous Express app, this app is hosted for in Heroku for free, so it might take a some time before the page loads the first time, I will be migrating all my sites to Heroku in the future this slowness is only temporary.</p>

    <h3>Express Photos<span class="small">(Node.js, Express.js, API, & Full Stack Development)</span></h3>
    <p>I started using express a couple of weeks ago and I created this quick app, that takes a user's input and returns a series of images matching the user's criteria, using the 500px API. Bear in mind this app is currently hosted on Heroku, so it might be slow to load at first.</p>

    <h3>Ember CLI Travel<span class="small">(Ember & API Development)</span></h3>
    <p>Travel application that based on a user's input connect to multiple APIs to retrieve the weather forecast, top activities, pictures and a short description. During the development process I decided to use the following APIs Wikipedia, Foursquare, Flickr and OpenWeather. In the future I will add more features like the ability to favorite a destination, google maps and fix a few minor bugs.</p>

    <p>Connecting to Flickr's API this little JS plugin will display the latest 6 posts from a given user's account, I also created a wordpress plugin with an admin panel to edit the user name and amount of pictures to display, you can download it from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aroget/wp_flickr_plugin">here</a></p>

    <h3>Voting Platform<span class="small">(PHP, JS Development)</span></h3>
    <p>I remembered when I first started coding, having to pass a project to a friend as it required some voting mechanism that was way over my skills at that time, that is why I decided to give it a try one more time now that I have more experience in this topic, the app is quite simple, all the data is stored in a SQL database, and it accepts new entries in the way of votes, which are then updated upon page refresh, I may tweak it a bit in the near future to make it a bit more useful.</p>

    <h3>Photography Portfolio<span class="small">(Middleman Development)</span></h3>
    <p>Another of my hobbies is photography, I used to have a custom wordpress theme (developed by me), but I noticed having all the extra wordpress stuff in there didn't really help in fact more often than not it was slowing down the site so I decided to turn it into a static page portfolio, served via a CDN, to make the whole experience that much faster, the design may use a bit of work though.</p>
